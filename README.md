Fiori Applications Development

The first application is an easy one. 
On the backend (Eclipse + ADT + BTP Free Trial account), for this development two tables were created:
- ZTORDERS_HEADER
- ZTORDERS_ITEM
At this point, the freestyle Fiori application will show a master list with the
data from the orders header. In case of a click on any order, it will present
more details on the requested order.

In the future, this will have more fields added, such as:
- Total value of order;
- Delivery address;
- More informations/detail on the order;
Additionaly, will add some user actions such as: change the order status.

And finally, it will end by adding a map to check where the order is at that moment.
